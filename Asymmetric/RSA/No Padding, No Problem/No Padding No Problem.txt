Solving:
1)Since we know n e and c we have m=c^d mod n but we need d and since program does not accept c we need to
somehow send "modified" c but still be able to know m. One way is to use c^d mod n = (c+n)^d mod n since
n mod n is always 0 so the result of decryption will be just m, so we send c+n to the program and get the flag

2)Unpadded RSA is homomorphic which means that we can perform operations on encrypted data without first decrypting it
so: encrypt(m1) * encrypt(m2) = ((m1^e) * (m2^e)) mod n = (m1 * m2)^e mod n = encrypt(m1 * m2)
Since we know that we can send known value such as 2 and encrypt by m2=2^e mod n so now we can calculate c*m2
and decrypt it in program so we get 2m from where we have the flag
