Looking at such a big value of e, it had to be Wiener's Attack or it's variant. But we cannot move further without decoding the values.

The part below is purely guessing

So, one of my teammates suggested looking at the distinct characters in the encoded strings. Here are the distinct characters present in the encoded strings:

['A', 'b', 'E', 'g', 'l', 'O', 'S', 'B', 'T', 'Z']

10 distinct characters, 10 digits in decimal system. So, each character represents a digit. But how do we map them?

'O' --> 0
'l' --> 1
'Z' --> 2
'E' --> 3
'A' --> 4
'S' --> 5
'b' --> 6
'T' --> 7
'B' --> 8
'g' --> 9
