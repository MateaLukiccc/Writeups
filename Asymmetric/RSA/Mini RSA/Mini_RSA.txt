Solving:

1)since we cant find factors of n we can rewrite encryption process m^e mod n =c as
m^3=Tn+c where T is some constant (example 7 mod 5 = 2 <==> 7=T*5+2)
and from there m=(Tn+c)^(1/e) and since m^e is barely larger then n quessing value of T wont take that long 

Since python cant handle operations on this numbers we use library gmpy2
