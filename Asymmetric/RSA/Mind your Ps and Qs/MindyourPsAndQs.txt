Solving:
1)Solve with python library pycrypto (Crypto.Util.number) and compute p and q from factordb online
basics of RSA:

c is ciphertext that we need to decrypt
p and q are primes
n is the result of p*q
phi=(p-1)(q-1)
e is public exponent- public key
d is private exponent- private key
m is plaintext-message

key generation is 5 step process:
	1)choose 2 primes p and q
	2)find n: n=p*q
	3)calculate Eulers function phi=(p-1)(q-1)
	4)choose public key e
	5)compute d such that d*e mod phi = 1

in this case we need d with given n and e so d*e=1 mod phi 
we can se that d is modular inverse (mod phi) of e

encryption operation => m^e mod n = c
decryption operation => m=c^d (mod n)
