Solving:
1)We are given ciphertext and it is said that key consists of 8-character word CHALENGE(typo is intentional)
Since AES can have 128 bit key, 192 bit key or 256 bit key, the key can only be CHALENGECHALENGE (8*16=128 bit), CHALENGECHALENGECHALENGE and 
CHALENGECHALENGECHALENGECHALENGE. We are not given the IV so we can assume ECB is the used mode and when we input all info in CyberChief we get
the string that ends with == so we can guess that it is base64 and it is so we can get the flag

Solution:
This text contains the relevant flag val: very_easy_to_find_flag
