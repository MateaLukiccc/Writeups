TFCCTF 2022

Solving:
1)We are given only one function that pads our plaintext so that len(plaintext) is divisible by 16 it pads it with "?" or b'\x3f'
key is random generated 16 bits and ciphertext is writen in a file in hex form after being xored with key that loops around if len(pt)>16
So since we know that pt is begining with TFCCTF{ we know 7 of 16 key bits since we know that plaintext is of len 16*3 we can get coresponding plaintext bits
TFCCTF{XXXXXXXXX_h4s_l3XXXXXXXXX4ti0n}?XXXXXXXXX is what we get from said operation
We can see that known flag ends in ? so we can guess that last 10 chars of flag are ?????????? so xoring it with ct we get the rest of the plaintext

Solution:
TFCCTF{th3_tr41n_h4s_l3ft_th3_st4t10n}
